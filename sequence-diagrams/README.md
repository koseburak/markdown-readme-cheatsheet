# Sequence Diagrams


## Basic Example

### Code:
```
sequenceDiagram
    Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob-->>John: How about you John?
    Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
    Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
    Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

    Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
    Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

### Output:
::: mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob-->>John: How about you John?
    Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
    Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
    Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

    Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
    Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?

## Loops, alt and opt Example

### Code:
```
sequenceDiagram
    loop Daily query

        alt is sick
            Bob->>Alice: Not so good :(
        else is well

        opt Extra response
            Bob->>Alice: Thanks for asking
        end
    end
```

### Output:
::: mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    loop Daily query
        Alice->>Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
        alt is sick
            Bob->>Alice: Not so good :(

## Blogging app service communication Example

### Code:
```
sequenceDiagram
    participant web as Web Browser
    participant blog as Blog Service
    participant account as Account Service
    participant mail as Mail Service
    participant db as Storage

    Note over web,db: The user must be logged in to submit blog posts
    web->>+account: Logs in using credentials
    account->>db: Query stored accounts
    db->>account: Respond with query result

    alt Credentials not found

## A commit flow diagram Example

### Code:
```
gitGraph:
    commit "Ashish"

    checkout main
    commit type: HIGHLIGHT
    commit
    merge newbranch
    commit
    branch feat/task-1
    commit
```

### Output:
:::mermaid
gitGraph:
    commit "Ashish"
    branch newbranch
    checkout newbranch
    commit id:"1111"
    commit tag:"test"
    checkout main
    commit type: HIGHLIGHT
